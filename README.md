Frogger Arcade Game
===============================

# How to play the game
## Deployment:
Either you download this the GitHub repository (or clone it). Then you open the index.html with a browser. 
You can also play the game here: [https://yoyogruber.github.io/FEND-arcade-game](https://yoyogruber.github.io/FEND-arcade-game).

## Controlling the player
User the 'left' 'right' 'up' 'down' arrow keys to control the player. 

## Goal
The goal of the game is to bring the player onto the other side (waterline) without being hit by a bug.

# Used frameworks
I used the alertify library and the semantic theme that can all be found here [https://alertifyjs.com/](https://alertifyjs.com/).
